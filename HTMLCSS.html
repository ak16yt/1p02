 <br />

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<div>
<p><strong><em>The red wolf, also known as the Florida black wolf or Mississippi Valley wolf, is a smaller and a more slender cousin of the gray wolf. It is gray-black, with a reddish cast that gives it the color for which it is named.</em></strong></p>

<h2>POPULATION</h2>

<p><strong><em>Almost hunted to the brink of extinction, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rounded up fewer than 20 red wolves to be bred in captivity in 1980. As of 2007, approximately 207 captive red wolves reside at 38 captive breeding facilities across the United States. However, fewer than 45 red wolves currently live in the wild.</em></strong></p>
